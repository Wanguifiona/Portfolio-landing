          <p><strong> About me:</strong>
          <p>Hi, I am a Software Development Student!</p>
          <p> I'm a recent Bcom graduate with a major in Finance and Entrepreneurship from Starthmore University.I have worked at banks for my attchment school program and post graduation and while working there I realized I wanted to create, create something that can impact my business which I am carring on right now. We leave in a world where the internet is our new normal, we shop online, order online, communicate online using platforms like IG, FB and Twitter with people all over the world and as a result most businesses need to have a great online presence which can either make or break a business.As a result of what our future holds in regards to the internet and what growth I want for my business I believe that learning programming in the best institute in our country like  <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> is exactly what i need.</p>
          <p>Before the world got hit by one of the worst pandemic -<em>COVID-19</em>- we have experienced in a long time that hit almost every country in the world, I wanted to travel, see the world not just from our screens on phones or Television but in person.Experience different culture, be daring and do things i would never do like Bungee jamping over a waterfall or cliff, see amazing hisorical things like the Acropolis in Athens or Saint Mark's Basilica, help build communities, you know leave a mark no matter how small to others. The pandemic really put a dump on my plans but i belive i will get to see this places one day</p>
